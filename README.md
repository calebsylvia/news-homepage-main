# Code out the Tech News Home Page prototype we were given as accurately as possible

# Peer Review: Desktop 1440px and mobile 375px are very close to the prototype! I do have one suggestion to make the mobile menu icon line length a little bit longer or switch it out for the provided asset. I like that you added the custom classes for font and colors in the tailwind.config.js, very cool!
